MrTech is a remake of an old Freenode bot that was written in .NET. Right now,
MrTech can basically only do Urban Terror 4 server stats lookups.

Commands
$urt [host/ip[:port]]
	Get the specified UrT server's stats, or the default server if no params.

--------------
MrTech uses Scott's awesome on_irc library, v1.0.
